<b>FINDERS KEEPERS, P203a</b><br>

When Jorge digs up a shark tooth necklace in the courtyard, it is taken from him and given to its rightful owner. He cannot understand why “Finders Keepers Loser Weepers” (the children’s proverb of dubious ethical merit) doesn’t apply.  He takes the necklace back and buries it again.  Clifford sees this and must decide if he should dig it up and return it, or protect his friend - even though he believes that Jorge is wrong.   Clifford resolves the problem by convincing Jorge to do the right thing.<br>
